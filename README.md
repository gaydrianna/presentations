This is a folder of my research presentation materials in varied venues.

[SUNYLA_2023: Critical Information Literacy: Imaging Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Library Instruction Practice](https://gaydrianna.github.io/presentations/sunyla23.pdf)
Description: Libraries and their agents must acknowledge the role of information literacy in reinforcing colonial wounds. This presentation will imagine what information literacy would be like if placed within a postcolonial digital humanities theoretical framework. Informed by the work and pedagogy of Roopika Risam, this presentation will center students' agency in the digital cultural record as a cornerstone for understanding and navigating academic knowledge spaces. 

[DHSI_2023: Postcolonial Pedagogical Exploration of Open Mapping](https://gaydrianna.github.io/presentations/DHSI23mapping.pdf)
Description: Informed by Roopika Risam’s work in postcolonial digital humanities pedagogy, this presentation will explore a postcolonial approach to introducing the topic of digital mapping by shifting power and focusing on the ways that open mapping has expanded the digital cultural record. This presentation will highlight participatory mapping and explore the roots of this practice in the social survey movement with Jane Addams, Florence Kelly, and W.E.B. Du Bois’s work in maps. Exploring the significance of these projects lifts up the work of these humanists as well as reinforces their expansion of the digital cultural record in significant ways. We will discuss and explore digital maps, specifically street maps, and the projects that have propelled this democratization of the digital space in the field of digital humanities.

I argue that the visualization practice built out of the social survey movement, such as W. E. B. Du Bois’ work created the framework for how open street mapping projects today are built. In this session we will explore works by scholars Stephanie Boddie, and Amy Hillier in exploring Du Bois research and the continuation of this work in examples which center public health, humanitarian projects(HOTOSM) and others (Morris Justice Project). We will then switch the conversation to one about participation in the building of these spaces, and usage of these tools as a pedagogical element in and of itself.
